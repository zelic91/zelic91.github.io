For such a long time, I haven't written anything meaningful. This is not a good sign. 

<!--more-->

When I'm exciting to learn new things, I dive deep down into the study and experiment. After that, I'm completely satisfied with what I achieve in term of visible result. But that is not learning, it's just playing. And solely, playing without gaining experience is just a waste of time.

In order to make myself great again (if I'm ever great once), I build this blog to record every pieces that I feel useful (and forgettable). This serves two purpose:

1. I can re-learn and re-check the knowledge I obtain.
2. Share the knowledge to all of you and cross my fingers, hoping you find it useful.

That's it. Simple way to start.
